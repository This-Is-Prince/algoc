# A collection of classic data structures and algorithms implemented in C, optimized for performance and clarity.
Welcome to the Algorithms and Data Structures in C project!

This repository is a comprehensive resource for learning and practicing algorithms and data structures using the C programming language. The project is organized into chapters, each focusing on a specific topic or concept, starting from the basics of C and progressing to advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Chapters

- [C Concepts](c_concepts/)
	- Covers fundamental C programming concepts, including arrays, functions, pointers, structures, and more. Start here if you're new to C or want to strengthen your basics.
- [Recursion](recursion/)
	- Learn how recursion works in C, with examples and exercises to build a strong foundation.
- **Coming Soon:**
	- ADT (Abstract Data Types)
	- Trees
	- Graphs
	- Sorting & Searching Algorithms
	- And many more advanced topics!

Each chapter contains code samples, explanations, and exercises to help you master the topic. Feel free to explore the folders, run the code, and contribute your own solutions or improvements.
